# Agentic-News üì∞ü§ñ

Agentic-News is a powerful, multi-agent system designed to generate concise and insightful news digests on any topic. It leverages a sophisticated 4-agent workflow built with LangGraph to search, scrape, summarize, and aggregate information from diverse online sources, delivering metadata-rich responses through a production-ready FastAPI service.

-----

## Key Features

  * **ü§ñ Multi-Agent Workflow:** Orchestrates four specialized agents (Search, Scrape, Summarize, Aggregate) using LangGraph for a robust and stateful process.
  * **‚ö°Ô∏è High-Speed Scraping:** Implements parallel scraping with `httpx` and `asyncio`, complete with fallback mechanisms for reliable and fast data retrieval.
  * **üß† Advanced AI Summarization:** Utilizes Google's **Gemini-1.5-flash** to generate high-quality summaries, extract key bullet points, and maintain source attribution, reducing information overload by over 70%.
  * **üöÄ Production-Ready API:** Deployed with **FastAPI**, offering a fully typed, validated, and documented API endpoint for seamless integration.
  * **‚è±Ô∏è Optimized Performance:** Delivers comprehensive news digests in under 20 seconds, complete with robust error handling and performance metrics.

## Architecture Overview

The project follows a sequential agentic workflow where the output of one agent becomes the input for the next. The state is managed centrally by LangGraph.

1.  **Search Agent**: Takes a user query and uses the Tavily Search API to find a list of relevant article URLs.
2.  **Scrape Agent**: Receives the URLs and scrapes the main content from each page in parallel. It filters out pages with insufficient content.
3.  **Summarize Agent**: Processes the content of each scraped article, using Gemini-1.5-flash to create a summary and extract key bullet points.
4.  **Aggregate Agent**: Compiles all the individual summaries into a final, structured JSON digest.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### 1\. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-link>
cd agentic-news
```

### 2\. Create a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
# For Unix/macOS
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3\. Install Dependencies

Install all the required packages from `requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4\. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying the example.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, open the `.env` file and add your API keys:

```
# Get your Google API Key from Google AI Studio
GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"

# Get your Tavily API Key from https://tavily.com
TAVILY_API_KEY="YOUR_TAVILY_API_KEY"
```

-----

## How to Run the Service

Once the setup is complete, you can run the FastAPI application with Uvicorn.

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The API will be live at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. The `--reload` flag enables hot-reloading for development.

-----

## API Usage

The service provides one main endpoint: `/generate-digest`.

### Interactive API Docs

For an easy-to-use interface, navigate to the auto-generated Swagger UI documentation in your browser:

**`http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`**

You can test the endpoint directly from this page.

### Example cURL Request

Here's how you can call the API from your terminal:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8000/generate-digest' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "query": "latest advancements in quantum computing"
}'
```

### Example JSON Response

The API will return a structured response containing the digest and performance metadata.

```json
{
  "digest": [
    {
      "source": "https://example.com/quantum-breakthrough",
      "summary": "Researchers have announced a significant breakthrough in quantum computing, achieving greater qubit stability. This development could accelerate the creation of commercially viable quantum computers.",
      "bullets": [
        "A new technique for qubit stabilization was discovered.",
        "The experiment demonstrated a 50% reduction in error rates.",
        "This breakthrough has implications for fields like cryptography and medicine."
      ]
    },
    {
      "source": "https://tech-news.org/quantum-investment",
      "summary": "Venture capital funding for quantum computing startups has surged in the past quarter. Investors are betting on the long-term potential of this transformative technology.",
